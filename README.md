Instructions:

To generate the dataset used, first run `Features.py`. The implementation of the neural network can be found within `NeuralNetwork.py`. Hyperparameter tuning, final training, and evaluation of the ReLU and sigmoid networks as well as the training and evaluation of the linear regression can be found in `results.py`. **NOTE:** `results.py` has an extremely long runtime due to grid search and multiple trainings of the neural networks in cross validation.
